# ajalong2020
My portfolio site for 2020. I wanted to get this made really fast so I bought [semplice](https://www.semplice.com/) (which is the first wysiwyg wordpress theme I like) and threw it together locally. I then generated a static version which is depolyed through [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). This gives me the benifits of a dynamic site and the performance of a static site! Want to try something similar but can't afford Semplice? [ThemeBeans](https://themebeans.com/) have some great free themes.

**Next challenge:** recreate the site with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/).
